# Captain Of Industry Mods

This project is more of a reverse engineering exercise than an ongoing mod project.
I will try to keep it up to date with my latest findings on this awesome game!

## Installation
You can download the mods archive from the GitHub Release section and you need to extract it in the %userprofile%\documents\CaptainOfIndustry\mods directory. Note that you must keep the directory structure for them to work (eg. the CheatMenu.dll file must reside in the CheatMenu directory).

## Cheat menu

That mod will gives you access to a menu exposing some cheats. Hit the F8 key to open the menu while inside a game.
